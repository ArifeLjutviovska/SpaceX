### About This Project
This is a full-stack web application built with **Angular, .NET, and SQL** that allows users to view 
SpaceX launches while handling **user authentication, profile management, and secure JWT authentication**.
This web application allows users to:
 -  Sign up and Log in securely using JWT with HttpOnly cookies
 -  View SpaceX missions (Latest, Upcoming, and Past launches)
 -  Update their profile and change/reset password
 -  Logout securely
 -  Fully responsive design

This project follows best practices for security, scalability, and modularity in a .NET + Angular stack.

## üö® Troubleshooting
### ‚ùå **Error: "User Declined Directory Sharing"**
If you see an error like this:
 ```Error response from daemon: user declined directory sharing C:\Users\username\SpaceX\docker-compose\spacex-db.sql```
It means **Docker Desktop needs permission** to access your project files.

### ‚úÖ **Fix: Enable File Sharing in Docker Desktop**
1. **Open Docker Desktop**.
2. **Go to Settings ‚öô ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing**.
3. **Click "Add"** and select: ```path-to-the-cloned-project-on-your-local-machine/SpaceX```
4. Click **"Apply & Restart"**.

### ‚úÖ **Alternative Fix: Move the Project to Another Drive**
If you don‚Äôt want to enable file sharing:
1. **Move the project to another drive** (e.g., `D:\SpaceX`).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project:
```cd D:\SpaceX```
3. Run the docker containers:
   ```docker-compose up --build```
üöÄ After this, Docker should start successfully!
