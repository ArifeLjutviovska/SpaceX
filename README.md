## About This Project
This is a full-stack web application built with **Angular, .NET, and SQL** that allows users to view 
SpaceX launches while handling **user authentication, profile management, and secure JWT authentication**.
This web application allows users to:
 -  Sign up and Log in securely using JWT with HttpOnly cookies
 -  View SpaceX missions (Latest, Upcoming, and Past launches)
 -  Update their profile and change/reset password
 -  Logout securely
 -  Fully responsive design
   
This project follows best practices for security, scalability, and modularity in a .NET + Angular stack.

SpaceX launches for showing to the user are get from this API: [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)


## Technologies Used

##  Setup & Installation with Docker
  **1. Clone the Repository:**
  
   Open terminal and go to the folder that  you want to clone the project on your local machine. And run the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ArifeLjutviovska/SpaceX.git
   ```
 **2. Navigate into the Project Directory:**
 
   Run the following command on your terminal.
 ```sh
   cd SpaceX
   ```
  Now you will see the project structure.
  
 **3. Download the .env File from GitHub Actions:**
 
   - You will see that on SpaceX folder we have ```docker-compose```  folder. In order for application to run you need to have ```.env``` file on ```docker-compose``` folder.
   - You can get the ```.env``` file by following these steps: [Get Environment File](#get-environment-file)
   - After successfull download of .env file, move the downloaded ```.env``` file to ```SpaceX/docker-compose``` folder on the cloned project. The location of the ```.env``` should be on the same directory as ```.env.template```

 **4. Start the Project Using Docker Compose:**
 
 If you are on SpaceX folder run the following commands on your terminal:
 
  ```sh
   cd docker-compose
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

If you are already on SpaceX/docker-compose folder on your terminal, just run the following command:
  ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
**Note: Encountering an issue?**

  If you see an error like **"User Declined Directory Sharing"** while running the docker containers, [click here](#troubleshooting) for the fix.

**5. Test the application:**

 You can test the application with these routes:
 - Frontend: http://localhost:4300
 - Backend API: http://localhost:7005

**NOTE:** If your local machine uses those ports for angular and backend (4300 or 7005) for some other processes, running the docker containers will fail. You can change the ports like this: [Default Ports In Use](#default-ports-in-use)



##  Setup & Installation On Local Machine

  **1. Clone the Repository:**
  
   Open terminal and go to the folder that  you want to clone the project on your local machine. And run the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ArifeLjutviovska/SpaceX.git
   ```
 **2. Navigate into the Project Directory:**
 
   - Run the following command on your terminal.
 ```sh
   cd SpaceX
   ```
  Now you will see the project structure.

 **3. Set up the database:**
 - Ensure SQL Server is running
 - Create  Database connection on SQL Server [click here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/create-a-database?view=sql-server-ver16)
 - Modify **appsettings.json** which is in SpaceX/SpacexApp/SpacexServer.Api directory, change the connection string with your database connection string
 - Modify **TargetConnectionString** in Spacex.Database.SqlDb.xml, which is in SpaceX/SpacexApp/Spacex.Database folder
 - Publish the database with those options:

   
   **a) Option 1:**
   
  If you have ```SqlPackage.exe``` installed, then execute the following command, replace "C:\path-to\Spacex.Database.SqlDb.xml" with the actual file path and replace SpacexDB with your database name:
```sh
    SqlPackage.exe /Action:Publish /SourceFile:"Spacex/SpacexApp/Spacex.Database/Spacex.Database.SqlDb.xml" /TargetConnectionString:"data source=YOUR_SQL_SERVER;User Id=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;initial catalog=Spacex;TrustServerCertificate=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;"
  ```
   **b) Option 2:**
   
   If you have **Visual Studio IDE** open the SpacexServer.sln on Visual Studio, and on Databases you will see ```Spacex.Database.SqlDb.xml```, click to the file, after that a window pop-up will be shown, add the database connection and click **Publish**.

   **c) Option 3:**

In SpaceX/docker-compose folder there is `spacex-db.sql` file, after connecting the datatabse, run this query manually to create the required tables.

**4.  Run the Backend:**
 - Modify **appsettings.json** which is in SpaceX/SpacexApp/SpacexServer.Api directory, Add JWT_SECRET in ```JwtSettings:Secret```, it should have at least 32 byte, you can generate by running this command on your terminal: ```openssl rand -base64 32```
 - The run the following commands:
   
      ```sh
      cd SpaceX/SpacexApp/SpacexServer.Api
      dotnet restore
      dotnet run
    ```

**5.  Run the Frontend:**

   ```sh
    cd SpaceX/SpacexApp/Spacex.Client/spacex-angular
    npm install
    ng serve --open
   ```
 
 **6. Test the application:**

 You can test the application with these routes:
 - Frontend: http://localhost:4200
 - Backend API: http://localhost:7005

**NOTE:** If your local machine uses those ports for angular and backend (4200 or 7005) for some other processes, running of the application will fail. You can change the ports like this: [Default Ports In Use](#default-ports-in-use)

## üìåTroubleshooting
‚ùå **Error: "User Declined Directory Sharing"**
If you see an error like this:
 ```Error response from daemon: user declined directory sharing path-to-project\SpaceX\docker-compose\spacex-db.sql```
It means **Docker Desktop needs permission** to access your project files.

**a. Fix: Enable File Sharing in Docker Desktop**
1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Go to Settings ‚öô ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing.
3. Click "Add" and select: ```path-to-the-cloned-project-on-your-local-machine/SpaceX```
4. Click **"Apply & Restart"**.

**b. Alternative Fix: Move the Project to Another Drive**
If you don‚Äôt want to enable file sharing:
1. Move the project to another drive (e.g., `D:\SpaceX`).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project:
```cd D:\SpaceX```
3. Run the docker containers:
   ```docker-compose up --build```

    
üöÄ After this, Docker should start successfully!

## üìåDefault Ports In Use

By default, the application runs on:

- Frontend (Angular): On docker:  ```http://localhost:4300```, locally:  ```http://localhost:4200```
- Backend API (.NET): ```http://localhost:7005```
  
If these ports are already in use on your machine, you can change them as follows:

**1. If you run the project locally:**

 **Frontend (Angular)**
   - Modify **Program.cs** in SpacexServer.Api, find this code in Program.cs: ```.WithOrigins("http://localhost:4300", "http://localhost:4200")``` add the url (http://localhost:{port_number}).
   - Run Angular on a different port using: ``` ng serve --port=4500 ```  Or you can change your port based on your preference.  
   - Then access the frontend at http://localhost:4500

  **Backend API (.NET)**

  - Open Properties/launchSettings.json inside SpacexServer.Api.
  - Change ```ASPNETCORE_URLS``` to some port rather then 7005
  - Modify **Program.cs** in SpacexServer.Api, find this code: ```options.ListenAnyIP(7005);``` and change it to your preffered port.
  - Restart the backend and use http://localhost:{port_number}.

**2. If you run the project on Docker:**

  **Frontend (Angular)**
   - Change ```EXPOSE 4300``` in Dockerfile on spacex-angular folder
   - Change **docker-compose.yml** which is in SpaceX/docker-compose folder, you will need to change the port for **SpacexServer.Client** to the port you added in Dockerfile. Change the following code:
  ```sh
         ports:
         - "4300:4300"
   ```

   **Backend API (.NET)**
     
  - Open Properties/launchSettings.json inside SpacexServer.Api.
  - Change ```ASPNETCORE_URLS``` to some port rather then 7005
  - Modify **Program.cs** in SpacexServer.Api, find this code: ```options.ListenAnyIP(7005);``` and change it to your preffered port.
  - Change **docker-compose.yml** which is in SpaceX/docker-compose folder, you will need to change the port for **SpacexServer.Api** to the port you added in launchSettings.json. Change the following code:
  ```sh
         ports:
         - "7005:7005"
   ```
